for holiday shopping but there are some downsides to consider.
I'm seeking insight from shopping/credit card experts on the
following:

1. What are the main pros/advantages of opening a new retail
rewards card for holiday shopping? 2. What are the biggest cons
of doing so? 3. How can consumers decide which cards to open?
And when would it make more sense to stick with a traditional
rewards card instead? 4. What are best practices for using
retail rewards cards for holiday shopping and paying off those
balances later? 5. What's the best way to use the rewards you've
earned with a retail store card during the holidays?

Our Thought Leaders in Online Education (TLOE) blog is a
follow-up to our highly successful Thought Leaders series (TLBD,
TLCC, TLMS). In TLOE, we interview thought leaders in the
educational technology/online education sectors -- whether they
are entrepreneurs building great companies, product/user
experience designers building great products, deans at colleges
and universities, or executives at large companies with unique
perspectives on how the education industry is evolving. We
discuss trends, disruptions, entrepreneurial opportunities,
monetization models, challenges, socio-cultural impact and much
more in a seven-part series. This blog is part of the One
Million by One Million global initiative, whose aim is to help a
million entrepreneurs reach $1 million in annual revenue. 1M/1M
has syndication relationships with many venues: HBR, Xconomy,
SmallBizTrends, EconomicTimes (India), Women 2.0, Mashable,
Huffington Post, Business Insider, ReadWriteWeb, and several
other sites. Articles we develop through these interviews often
get repackaged for the syndication partners. The 1Mby1M blog was
named by Forbes in the Top 100 Blog for Entrepreneurs
(http://onforb.es/1a6RkOs) and among the top 100 influencers on
the topic of cloud computing. Sramana Mitra was also named as
one of the top 10 LinkedIn influencers of 2015
(https://goo.gl/AN9TjS). Indicate in your pitch the revenue
level, as we use this as a qualification criterion for selecting
entrepreneurs to profile. We don't necessarily have to publish
this number in the actual story. Our audience is extremely
sophisticated, so the conversation needs to be equally
interesting.

Category: High Tech

Email: query-9z75@helpareporter.net

Media Outlet: Channel Futures
Deadline: 11:00 PM PST - 25 October

Query:

There has been a lot of controversy among the browser makers,
certificate authorities (CAs) and others about how long SSL
certificates should last. They currently last 24-27 months but
the browser makers would like to shorten that to just 12 months. 

This may be related to CAs in some Middle Eastern and Central
Asian countries issuing SSL certificates to dubious entities or
diverting internet traffic suspiciously. 

This could all have a negative impact on the user experience and
more importantly endpoint security. This article will explore
some of these issues. Tell me about:

1. What is the current controversy at the CA/B Forum and your
perspective on it? See link
https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/ssl-certificates-one-year-max-validity-ballot-fails-at-the-ca-b-forum/


2. What should browser makers do to use the latest generation of
SSL/TLS tech to secure the internet connection at the endpoint?
See link
https://www.techrepublic.com/article/tls-1-3-is-approved-heres-how-it-could-make-the-entire-internet-safer/


3. How are CAs in Asia and the Middle East behaving in regards
to issuance of SSL certificates to questionable organizations?
See link
https://cpj.org/2019/07/kazakhstan-government-backed-security-certificate-.php


4. What are nation-states or their quasi-sanctioned hacker
groups doing to take advantage of internet traffic diversion and
gray-market SSL certificates to cover or enable their
underhanded machinations?

5. What else should I know about SSL certificates and endpoint
security?

In a content submission of up to 300 words--HARO limit, not
mine--tell me about your perspective to the above numbered
bullet point or add anything else I should know.

Include spokesperson name, real title (no ninjas of digital
environmentalism, etc.), company name, short factual description
(five words or less, no adjectives or superlatives) and partner
program backlink--if none then your homepage. If all above info
is not included your pitch may not be considered at all. Check

No phone interviews. Only HARO submissions considered.

If this HARO has expired feel free to send your submission to

I reserve the right to edit submissions for clarity,
conciseness, grammar, flow, SEO keywords, and fact checking and

Deadline: 12:00 PM EST - 28 October

Query:

For this story, I'm looking for chefs to weigh in on the notion
of "chef's choice" orders at restaurants. These days, lots of
restaurants feature tasting menus that are, by nature, up to the
chef's discretion. However, even at restaurants with
clearly-defined menus, some diners will ask their server to
"tell the chef to send out whatever he/she wants". This can
offer the chef an opportunity for creativity..but is it
annoying, when the chef takes the time to create a menu, to have
diners ask him/her to "go rogue"?

If you'd like to participate, send your name, location, the
restaurant/company where you work and your position, and 1-3
sentences explaining your thoughts on "chef's choice" ordering
at non-tasting-menu restaurants.

21) Summary: Need sources for story: Why now may be great time to do a cash-out refinance
Name: Erik Martin
Category: General

Email: query-9yy3@helpareporter.net

Media Outlet: CTW Features
Deadline: 12:00 PM CST - 4 November

Query:

Hello. My name is Erik Martin and I am a reporter for Real
Estate Weekly, a nationally syndicated section published weekly
in newspapers across the country (visit
tinyurl.com/ejmctwfeatures for samples). I'm looking to
interview real estate industry professionals, agents, brokers,
lenders, property attorneys, and other real estate pros for the
following topic:

Your cash-out refi clock is ticking: Why now may be a great time
to tap into your equity via a mortgage refinance. With mortgage
rates dropping and expected to remain low in the short-term, and
with millions of homeowners enjoying high rates of accrued
equity built up in their homes, that makes for a potential great
opportunity to reset your mortgage to a lower rate and pull
money out of your home (via a cash-out refi) in order to fund a
remodeling project, major purchase, or consolidate debt. This
story will explore the reasons why a cash-out refi right now
makes sense and the best way to pursue one. Below is a list of
questions I'm seeking answers to. I can either conduct a phone
or email interview (with the latter, please email me back
full-sentence written responses that I can use as quotes). My
deadline is noon central time, Monday, Nov. 4.

QUESTIONS: 1.	Why is now a particularly good time to consider a
cash-out refinance, especially for those who have a lot of home
equity to tap and considering the low rate climate? 2.	Who makes
a good candidate right now for a cashout refi? Who is a bad
candidate and why? Please give detailed scenarios for both
candidates. 3.	For a cashout refi to be worth it, what criteria
should the candidate meet? (e.g., shave at least �off their
rate, count on living in the home at least 5 more years, etc.)
4.	What can/should the cash-out funds be used for that
represents a smart purchase or investment (e.g., remodel
project, debt consolidation, etc.)? what represents a not so
smart investment of that money? 5.	What should owners consider
carefully and be aware of before they commit to a cashout refi
(e.g., closing costs, it will take time, rates may go even lower
after you lock, etc.)? 6.	Any other thoughts, tips or
suggestions on this topic? 7.	What is your full name, title,
company, city/state location

Name: Chris Elliott
Category: Travel

Email: query-9z2q@helpareporter.net

Media Outlet: King Features
Deadline: 7:00 PM EST - 25 October

Query:

I'm researching a story about automatic claims filed on behalf
of customers, particularly in the travel insurance space. Some
insurance companies have technology that can automatically
process a claim without any paperwork on behalf of the customer.
I'd love to hear from customers who have experienced an
automatic claim for something like flight delay. Did it make for
a better customer experience? From insurance companies, I'd be
interested in hearing about your program and how it works. How
many claims have you processed automatically? What's the
customer feedback been like? Finally, I'd love to hear from
insurance experts. What are the upsides or dowsides of automatic
claims? What do consumers need to be aware of when they receive
a payment from a travel insurance company? 

Requirements:

Please read this before answering. I'd be very grateful if you
could send an initial response to my questions by email. Please
do not respond with a note that says you would like to be
considered for this story or want to set up a phone interview
with a source. I'm happy to consider you for this story. I've
included all of my questions in this query. Please take a minute
to briefly answer them. If a phone interview is necessary, I
will follow up right away. Kindly also include your full name
and a jargon-free, brief (two to three word) description of your
company or affiliation as you would like it to appear in the
article. I will do my absolute best to acknowledge that I
received your pitch and will make every effort to let you know
when the story appears. More information on my queries can be

Query:

I'm working on a gift guide that will run in the Times of
Northwest Indiana (a daily newspaper that covers Northwest
Indiana, the south suburbs of Chicago and southwest Michigan).
The guide focuses on "experiences" as gifts for the holidays,
and I'm in need of some ideas! Experiences can include anything
from memberships to physical destinations or online educational
sites, to events such as wine tastings, movies, etc. They could
also be everything you need to host an occasion, such as a wine
tasting, chocolate tasting, camping, etc. If you have any other
ideas, I'm definitely open to them.

Requirements:

With the subject being "experiences," it's best that any events
or memberships to physical locations be regional (within an hour
or so of Chicago). But if it's online, or products you need to
hold an experience, then the company/organization can be located
anywhere.

63) Summary: Need sources for story: Why buying a home near public transportation is smart
Name: Erik Martin
Category: General

Media Outlet: CTW Features
Deadline: 12:00 PM CST - 4 November

Query:

Hello. My name is Erik Martin and I am a reporter for Real
Estate Weekly, a nationally syndicated section published weekly
in newspapers across the country (visit
tinyurl.com/ejmctwfeatures for samples). I'm looking to
interview real estate industry professionals, agents, brokers,
lenders, property attorneys, and other real estate pros for the
following topic:

Want a home that will be worth more? Move near public
transportation. A fresh report by the National Association of
Realtors (found at
https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/locations-close-to-public-transit-boost-residential-commercial-real-estate-values) 
shows that Neighborhoods located within a half-mile of public
transit services outperformed those in areas farther from public
transit based on a number of factors. The report explored seven
metropolitan regions - Boston; Hartford; Los Angeles;
Minneapolis-St. Paul; Phoenix; Seattle; and Eugene, OR - that
provide access to heavy rail, light rail, commuter rail, and bus
rapid transit. Residential properties within these areas had
4-24% higher median sale prices between 2012 and 2016, the
report found. Transportation costs in transit-oriented areas are
significantly lower than in other regions, with an average
annual savings of $2,500 to $4,400 for the typical household.
One in four households in close proximity to transit does not
own a vehicle, according to the study. This piece will examine
the study's findings and provide thoughts and recommendations
from experts as to why home shoppers should strongly consider
buying in an area with a good public transportation system.
Below is a list of questions I'm seeking answers to. I can
either conduct a phone or email interview (with the latter,
please email me back full-sentence written responses that I can
use as quotes). My deadline is noon central time, Monday, Nov. 4.

QUESTIONS: 1.	What did you find interesting about the
aforementioned study's findings and why? 2.	Why is it worthwhile
to buy and live near public transit services? What are the pros
and cons, and how can it save money and time in the long run? 3.
For whom does moving near public transit services make the most
sense? Who are not good candidates here and why? 4.	What
detailed tips can you suggest to those who are considering
buying a home near public transit services? How close should
those services be if they plan to use them? What is TOO close?
What minimum transit services should exist (e.g., rail AND
bus?)? 5.	Any other thoughts, tips or suggestions on this topic?
6.	What is your full name, title, company, city/state location

64) Summary: Need sources for story: How to reduce home sellers' fears about uncertainty
Name: Erik Martin

Media Outlet: CTW Features
Deadline: 12:00 PM CST - 4 November

Query:

Hello. My name is Erik Martin and I am a reporter for Real
Estate Weekly, a nationally syndicated section published weekly
in newspapers across the country (visit
tinyurl.com/ejmctwfeatures for samples). I'm looking to
interview real estate industry professionals, agents, brokers,
lenders, property attorneys, and other real estate pros for the
following topic:

A home seller's greatest fear? The unknown: Why uncertainty
causes more stress than showings and repairs. Factors that
traditionally have been harder for sellers to control -- like
uncertainty about timing and price -- cause the most stress, per
the 2019 Zillow Group Consumer Housing Trend Report (details at
http://zillow.mediaroom.com/2019-10-10-Uncertainty-Causes-More-Stress-for-Home-Sellers-than-Repairs-and-Showings). 
95% of home sellers said they consider some aspect of selling a
home stressful, but not knowing if a home will sell within the
desired time frame is the largest source of stress for sellers,
with 56% of them calling it a stressful experience. Meanwhile,
53% of sellers worry about not being able to sell their home for
the price they want, and 52% were stressed about an offer
falling through. One reason timing and financing a home sale can
be stressful is that many home sellers (64%) are buying another
home at the same time. In fact, 51% of home sellers specifically
found it stressful to time the sale of their current home with
the purchase of a new one. 52% of sellers worry about making
improvements to get a home ready to sell. Maintaining a
market-ready home is stressful for 43% of sellers, and 39%
stress about leaving the home for tours and open houses. This
story will highlight the important findings and offer expert
analysis on why sellers are stressed about these matters and how
they can better avoid/manage this stress. Below is a list of
questions I'm seeking answers to. I can either conduct a phone
or email interview (with the latter, please email me back
full-sentence written responses that I can use as quotes). My
deadline is noon central time, Monday, Nov. 4.

QUESTIONS: 1.	What did you find interesting about the
aforementioned study's findings and why? 2.	Why do you believe
uncertainty, especially about price and timing, can cause so
much stress for home sellers? What factors are behind this
phenomenon? 3.	Is it natural/normal for sellers to feel excess
stress due to uncertainty about price and timing, or is this
excessive and unnecessary in any way? Why/why not? 4.	What
detailed tips can you suggest for sellers to reduce/eliminate
their stress when it comes to uncertainty about price and
timing? What can/should they be doing?  5.	Any other thoughts,
tips or suggestions on this topic? 6.	What is your full name,
title, company, city/state location

Query:

Hello. My name is Erik Martin and I am a reporter for Real
Estate Weekly, a nationally syndicated section published weekly
in newspapers across the country (visit
tinyurl.com/ejmctwfeatures for samples). I'm looking to
interview ADU (auxiliary dwelling unit) experts, contractors,
real estate industry professionals, agents, brokers, lenders,
property attorneys, and other real estate pros for the following
topic:

ADU coup: How adding an auxiliary dwelling unit on your property
can be worth it. Also called "backyard bungalows" and "backyard
cottages," auxiliary dwelling units (ADUs) are proving more
popular, as they are able to be used as small rental units or
extra space for boomerang adult kids and aging parents (details
at
https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/21/backyard-bungalows-are-becoming-big-business.html). 
This article will examine why ADUs are popular, where they
can/can't be built, what they can/can't be used for, pros and
cons, costs, and effect on resale value. Below is a list of
questions I'm seeking answers to. I can either conduct a phone
or email interview (with the latter, please email me back
full-sentence written responses that I can use as quotes). My
deadline is noon central time, Monday, Nov. 4.

QUESTIONS: 1.	Please describe what an ADU is, where it is often
built/placed, and what it can be used for. 2.	Do you have any
stats/data you can cite that underscore how popular ADUs have
become and where they're being built? 3.	What are common square
footage size ranges for ADUs, and what are common price ranges
to have one built? 4.	Who make good candidates for an ADU? Who
is a bad candidate? 5.	What are the zoning laws regarding ADUs?
Do many towns not allow them to be built/used? How are they
insured? What are the legal rules and ramifications here? 6.
What should a homeowner consider carefully before choosing to
have an ADU built? What should they avoid? 7.	How/to what extent
can an ADU increase or decrease your property's resale value?
8.	Any other thoughts, tips or suggestions on this topic? 9.
What is your full name, title, company, city/state location

angle in terms of company-building experience. We use the
revenue level as a qualification criterion for selecting
entrepreneurs to profile. We don't necessarily have to publish
this number in the actual story. The Entrepreneur Journeys
series has already produced 12 books
(http://tinyurl.com/4p4phwy). You can see examples of the series
on our blog (http://tinyurl.com/d8m9mt). This blog is part of
the One Million by One Million global initiative, whose aim is
to help a million entrepreneurs reach $1 million in annual
revenue. We also use the EJ interviews as case studies to teach
other entrepreneurs how to navigate the entrepreneurial waters.
You get publicity, as well as a platform to share your lessons
from the trenches with a large number of aspiring and practicing
entrepreneurs. 1M/1M has syndication relationships with many
venues: HBR, Xconomy, SmallBizTrends, EconomicTimes (India),
Women 2.0, Mashable, Huffington Post, Business Insider,
ReadWriteWeb, and several other sites. Articles we develop
through these interviews often get repackaged for the
syndication partners. The 1Mby1M blog was named by Forbes in the
Top 100 Blog for Entrepreneurs (http://onforb.es/1a6RkOs). The
procedure is to have a one-hour interview by phone or in-person
in Menlo Park, at our office. We will provide the dial-in for
phone interviews, and the address for the in-person interviews.

Requirements:

When you send in your pitch, please be sure to include the
revenue level, as it is the primary criterion we use to select
stories. Unlike other entrepreneurship media, we do not look for
financing as a criterion for determining story worthiness. Also,
if your revenue threshold is below the $5M level currently, you
are welcome to email me, and I will check if your story might
fit in any of our other series. To give you a flavor, here are
some of our other ongoing series: The 1M/1M Deal Radar: Revenue
between $1M and $5M, high growth rate. We typically do email
interviews for this series. Thought Leader Interviews: We also
have Thought Leader Series opportunities in Cloud Computing,
Cyber Security, Mobile and Social, Big Data, Outsourcing, Online
Education, e-commerce, Gaming, Online Fashion, HealthcareIT,
Internet Of Things, etc. These require, however, that the
company has a minimum of $5M in revenue.

Solo dining is a thing, and single diners aren't shy about

dining. Americans now eat 50% of their means alone, as
households grow busier and more people make dining alone the new
normal. With numbers come power, and now solo diners have busted
out of the "dine alone" stigma and want restaurants to catch up
to the taste, nutrition and ambience demands of single eaters.
--- We need experts to examine the issue of solo dining. Why is
it becoming such a big topic? Why are there so many solo diners?
Is the stigma of dining out alone going away? Why or why not?
Or, how about ordering in and eating alone? How much of a trends
is that, as well? Any tips or programs that cater to solo
diners, eating out or at home? What's your take on the solo
dining issue and why?

Query:

Our Thought Leaders in Online Education (TLOE) blog is a
follow-up to our highly successful Thought Leaders series (TLBD,
TLCC, TLMS). In TLOE, we interview thought leaders in the
educational technology/online education sectors -- whether they
are entrepreneurs building great companies, product/user
experience designers building great products, deans at colleges
and universities, or executives at large companies with unique
perspectives on how the education industry is evolving. We
discuss trends, disruptions, entrepreneurial opportunities,
monetization models, challenges, socio-cultural impact and much
more in a seven-part series. This blog is part of the One
Million by One Million global initiative, whose aim is to help a
million entrepreneurs reach $1 million in annual revenue. 1M/1M
has syndication relationships with many venues: HBR, Xconomy,
SmallBizTrends, EconomicTimes (India), Women 2.0, Mashable,
Huffington Post, Business Insider, ReadWriteWeb, and several
other sites. Articles we develop through these interviews often
get repackaged for the syndication partners. The 1Mby1M blog was
named by Forbes in the Top 100 Blog for Entrepreneurs
(http://onforb.es/1a6RkOs) and among the top 100 influencers on
the topic of cloud computing. Sramana Mitra was also named as
one of the top 10 LinkedIn influencers of 2015
(https://goo.gl/AN9TjS). Indicate in your pitch the revenue
level, as we use this as a qualification criterion for selecting
entrepreneurs to profile. We don't necessarily have to publish
this number in the actual story. Our audience is extremely
sophisticated, so the conversation needs to be equally
interesting.

Category: High Tech

Email: query-9z75@helpareporter.net

Media Outlet: Channel Futures
Deadline: 11:00 PM PST - 25 October

Query:

There has been a lot of controversy among the browser makers,
certificate authorities (CAs) and others about how long SSL
certificates should last. They currently last 24-27 months but
the browser makers would like to shorten that to just 12 months. 

This may be related to CAs in some Middle Eastern and Central
Asian countries issuing SSL certificates to dubious entities or
diverting internet traffic suspiciously. 

This could all have a negative impact on the user experience and
more importantly endpoint security. This article will explore
some of these issues. Tell me about:

1. What is the current controversy at the CA/B Forum and your
perspective on it? See link
https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/ssl-certificates-one-year-max-validity-ballot-fails-at-the-ca-b-forum/


2. What should browser makers do to use the latest generation of
SSL/TLS tech to secure the internet connection at the endpoint?
See link
https://www.techrepublic.com/article/tls-1-3-is-approved-heres-how-it-could-make-the-entire-internet-safer/


3. How are CAs in Asia and the Middle East behaving in regards
to issuance of SSL certificates to questionable organizations?
See link
https://cpj.org/2019/07/kazakhstan-government-backed-security-certificate-.php


4. What are nation-states or their quasi-sanctioned hacker
groups doing to take advantage of internet traffic diversion and
gray-market SSL certificates to cover or enable their
underhanded machinations?

5. What else should I know about SSL certificates and endpoint
security?

In a content submission of up to 300 words--HARO limit, not
mine--tell me about your perspective to the above numbered
bullet point or add anything else I should know.

Include spokesperson name, real title (no ninjas of digital
environmentalism, etc.), company name, short factual description
(five words or less, no adjectives or superlatives) and partner
program backlink--if none then your homepage. If all above info
is not included your pitch may not be considered at all. Check

No phone interviews. Only HARO submissions considered.

If this HARO has expired feel free to send your submission to

I reserve the right to edit submissions for clarity,
conciseness, grammar, flow, SEO keywords, and fact checking and

Deadline: 12:00 PM EST - 28 October

Query:

For this story, I'm looking for chefs to weigh in on the notion
of "chef's choice" orders at restaurants. These days, lots of
restaurants feature tasting menus that are, by nature, up to the
chef's discretion. However, even at restaurants with
clearly-defined menus, some diners will ask their server to
"tell the chef to send out whatever he/she wants". This can
offer the chef an opportunity for creativity..but is it
annoying, when the chef takes the time to create a menu, to have
diners ask him/her to "go rogue"?

If you'd like to participate, send your name, location, the
restaurant/company where you work and your position, and 1-3
sentences explaining your thoughts on "chef's choice" ordering
at non-tasting-menu restaurants.

21) Summary: Need sources for story: Why now may be great time to do a cash-out refinance
Name: Erik Martin
Category: General

Email: query-9yy3@helpareporter.net

Media Outlet: CTW Features
Deadline: 12:00 PM CST - 4 November

Query:

Hello. My name is Erik Martin and I am a reporter for Real
Estate Weekly, a nationally syndicated section published weekly
in newspapers across the country (visit
tinyurl.com/ejmctwfeatures for samples). I'm looking to
interview real estate industry professionals, agents, brokers,
lenders, property attorneys, and other real estate pros for the
following topic:

Your cash-out refi clock is ticking: Why now may be a great time
to tap into your equity via a mortgage refinance. With mortgage
rates dropping and expected to remain low in the short-term, and
with millions of homeowners enjoying high rates of accrued
equity built up in their homes, that makes for a potential great
opportunity to reset your mortgage to a lower rate and pull
money out of your home (via a cash-out refi) in order to fund a
remodeling project, major purchase, or consolidate debt. This
story will explore the reasons why a cash-out refi right now
makes sense and the best way to pursue one. Below is a list of
questions I'm seeking answers to. I can either conduct a phone
or email interview (with the latter, please email me back
full-sentence written responses that I can use as quotes). My
deadline is noon central time, Monday, Nov. 4.

QUESTIONS: 1.	Why is now a particularly good time to consider a
cash-out refinance, especially for those who have a lot of home
equity to tap and considering the low rate climate? 2.	Who makes
a good candidate right now for a cashout refi? Who is a bad
candidate and why? Please give detailed scenarios for both
candidates. 3.	For a cashout refi to be worth it, what criteria
should the candidate meet? (e.g., shave at least �off their
rate, count on living in the home at least 5 more years, etc.)
4.	What can/should the cash-out funds be used for that
represents a smart purchase or investment (e.g., remodel
project, debt consolidation, etc.)? what represents a not so
smart investment of that money? 5.	What should owners consider
carefully and be aware of before they commit to a cashout refi
(e.g., closing costs, it will take time, rates may go even lower
after you lock, etc.)? 6.	Any other thoughts, tips or
suggestions on this topic? 7.	What is your full name, title,
company, city/state location

Name: Chris Elliott
Category: Travel

Email: query-9z2q@helpareporter.net

Media Outlet: King Features
Deadline: 7:00 PM EST - 25 October

Query:

I'm researching a story about automatic claims filed on behalf
of customers, particularly in the travel insurance space. Some
insurance companies have technology that can automatically
process a claim without any paperwork on behalf of the customer.
I'd love to hear from customers who have experienced an
automatic claim for something like flight delay. Did it make for
a better customer experience? From insurance companies, I'd be
interested in hearing about your program and how it works. How
many claims have you processed automatically? What's the
customer feedback been like? Finally, I'd love to hear from
insurance experts. What are the upsides or dowsides of automatic
claims? What do consumers need to be aware of when they receive
a payment from a travel insurance company? 

Requirements:

Please read this before answering. I'd be very grateful if you
could send an initial response to my questions by email. Please
do not respond with a note that says you would like to be
considered for this story or want to set up a phone interview
with a source. I'm happy to consider you for this story. I've
included all of my questions in this query. Please take a minute
to briefly answer them. If a phone interview is necessary, I
will follow up right away. Kindly also include your full name
and a jargon-free, brief (two to three word) description of your
company or affiliation as you would like it to appear in the
article. I will do my absolute best to acknowledge that I
received your pitch and will make every effort to let you know
when the story appears. More information on my queries can be

Query:

I'm working on a gift guide that will run in the Times of
Northwest Indiana (a daily newspaper that covers Northwest
Indiana, the south suburbs of Chicago and southwest Michigan).
The guide focuses on "experiences" as gifts for the holidays,
and I'm in need of some ideas! Experiences can include anything
from memberships to physical destinations or online educational
sites, to events such as wine tastings, movies, etc. They could
also be everything you need to host an occasion, such as a wine
tasting, chocolate tasting, camping, etc. If you have any other
ideas, I'm definitely open to them.

Requirements:

With the subject being "experiences," it's best that any events
or memberships to physical locations be regional (within an hour
or so of Chicago). But if it's online, or products you need to
hold an experience, then the company/organization can be located
anywhere.

63) Summary: Need sources for story: Why buying a home near public transportation is smart
Name: Erik Martin
Category: General

Media Outlet: CTW Features
Deadline: 12:00 PM CST - 4 November

Query:

Hello. My name is Erik Martin and I am a reporter for Real
Estate Weekly, a nationally syndicated section published weekly
in newspapers across the country (visit
tinyurl.com/ejmctwfeatures for samples). I'm looking to
interview real estate industry professionals, agents, brokers,
lenders, property attorneys, and other real estate pros for the
following topic:

Want a home that will be worth more? Move near public
transportation. A fresh report by the National Association of
Realtors (found at
https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/locations-close-to-public-transit-boost-residential-commercial-real-estate-values) 
shows that Neighborhoods located within a half-mile of public
transit services outperformed those in areas farther from public
transit based on a number of factors. The report explored seven
metropolitan regions - Boston; Hartford; Los Angeles;
Minneapolis-St. Paul; Phoenix; Seattle; and Eugene, OR - that
provide access to heavy rail, light rail, commuter rail, and bus
rapid transit. Residential properties within these areas had
4-24% higher median sale prices between 2012 and 2016, the
report found. Transportation costs in transit-oriented areas are
significantly lower than in other regions, with an average
annual savings of $2,500 to $4,400 for the typical household.
One in four households in close proximity to transit does not
own a vehicle, according to the study. This piece will examine
the study's findings and provide thoughts and recommendations
from experts as to why home shoppers should strongly consider
buying in an area with a good public transportation system.
Below is a list of questions I'm seeking answers to. I can
either conduct a phone or email interview (with the latter,
please email me back full-sentence written responses that I can
use as quotes). My deadline is noon central time, Monday, Nov. 4.

QUESTIONS: 1.	What did you find interesting about the
aforementioned study's findings and why? 2.	Why is it worthwhile
to buy and live near public transit services? What are the pros
and cons, and how can it save money and time in the long run? 3.
For whom does moving near public transit services make the most
sense? Who are not good candidates here and why? 4.	What
detailed tips can you suggest to those who are considering
buying a home near public transit services? How close should
those services be if they plan to use them? What is TOO close?
What minimum transit services should exist (e.g., rail AND
bus?)? 5.	Any other thoughts, tips or suggestions on this topic?
6.	What is your full name, title, company, city/state location

64) Summary: Need sources for story: How to reduce home sellers' fears about uncertainty
Name: Erik Martin

Media Outlet: CTW Features
Deadline: 12:00 PM CST - 4 November

Query:

Hello. My name is Erik Martin and I am a reporter for Real
Estate Weekly, a nationally syndicated section published weekly
in newspapers across the country (visit
tinyurl.com/ejmctwfeatures for samples). I'm looking to
interview real estate industry professionals, agents, brokers,
lenders, property attorneys, and other real estate pros for the
following topic:

A home seller's greatest fear? The unknown: Why uncertainty
causes more stress than showings and repairs. Factors that
traditionally have been harder for sellers to control -- like
uncertainty about timing and price -- cause the most stress, per
the 2019 Zillow Group Consumer Housing Trend Report (details at
http://zillow.mediaroom.com/2019-10-10-Uncertainty-Causes-More-Stress-for-Home-Sellers-than-Repairs-and-Showings). 
95% of home sellers said they consider some aspect of selling a
home stressful, but not knowing if a home will sell within the
desired time frame is the largest source of stress for sellers,
with 56% of them calling it a stressful experience. Meanwhile,
53% of sellers worry about not being able to sell their home for
the price they want, and 52% were stressed about an offer
falling through. One reason timing and financing a home sale can
be stressful is that many home sellers (64%) are buying another
home at the same time. In fact, 51% of home sellers specifically
found it stressful to time the sale of their current home with
the purchase of a new one. 52% of sellers worry about making
improvements to get a home ready to sell. Maintaining a
market-ready home is stressful for 43% of sellers, and 39%
stress about leaving the home for tours and open houses. This
story will highlight the important findings and offer expert
analysis on why sellers are stressed about these matters and how
they can better avoid/manage this stress. Below is a list of
questions I'm seeking answers to. I can either conduct a phone
or email interview (with the latter, please email me back
full-sentence written responses that I can use as quotes). My
deadline is noon central time, Monday, Nov. 4.

QUESTIONS: 1.	What did you find interesting about the
aforementioned study's findings and why? 2.	Why do you believe
uncertainty, especially about price and timing, can cause so
much stress for home sellers? What factors are behind this
phenomenon? 3.	Is it natural/normal for sellers to feel excess
stress due to uncertainty about price and timing, or is this
excessive and unnecessary in any way? Why/why not? 4.	What
detailed tips can you suggest for sellers to reduce/eliminate
their stress when it comes to uncertainty about price and
timing? What can/should they be doing?  5.	Any other thoughts,
tips or suggestions on this topic? 6.	What is your full name,
title, company, city/state location

Query:

Hello. My name is Erik Martin and I am a reporter for Real
Estate Weekly, a nationally syndicated section published weekly
in newspapers across the country (visit
tinyurl.com/ejmctwfeatures for samples). I'm looking to
interview ADU (auxiliary dwelling unit) experts, contractors,
real estate industry professionals, agents, brokers, lenders,
property attorneys, and other real estate pros for the following
topic:

ADU coup: How adding an auxiliary dwelling unit on your property
can be worth it. Also called "backyard bungalows" and "backyard
cottages," auxiliary dwelling units (ADUs) are proving more
popular, as they are able to be used as small rental units or
extra space for boomerang adult kids and aging parents (details
at
https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/21/backyard-bungalows-are-becoming-big-business.html). 
This article will examine why ADUs are popular, where they
can/can't be built, what they can/can't be used for, pros and
cons, costs, and effect on resale value. Below is a list of
questions I'm seeking answers to. I can either conduct a phone
or email interview (with the latter, please email me back
full-sentence written responses that I can use as quotes). My
deadline is noon central time, Monday, Nov. 4.

QUESTIONS: 1.	Please describe what an ADU is, where it is often
built/placed, and what it can be used for. 2.	Do you have any
stats/data you can cite that underscore how popular ADUs have
become and where they're being built? 3.	What are common square
footage size ranges for ADUs, and what are common price ranges
to have one built? 4.	Who make good candidates for an ADU? Who
is a bad candidate? 5.	What are the zoning laws regarding ADUs?
Do many towns not allow them to be built/used? How are they
insured? What are the legal rules and ramifications here? 6.
What should a homeowner consider carefully before choosing to
have an ADU built? What should they avoid? 7.	How/to what extent
can an ADU increase or decrease your property's resale value?
8.	Any other thoughts, tips or suggestions on this topic? 9.
What is your full name, title, company, city/state location

Query:

 Hi, My name is Sheldon Chi. I am responsible for coordinating
stories for the 1Mby1M blog [1mby1m.com]]. The Entrepreneur
Journeys (EJ) series is our flagship series and we're looking
for interesting companies with at least $5 million in annual
revenue to feature in lengthy feature stories. We are interested
in interviewing the entrepreneur who can and is willing to
discuss, at length, the nuances of the strategy and process of
company building, spanning topics such as bootstrapping,
financing, positioning, customer acquisition, channels, team
building, etc. To pitch, please provide revenue level, industry
(Our interests: E-Commerce, Cloud Computing, SaaS, Mobile,
Social, Big Data, IoT, FinTech, Digital Media, Gaming,
Healthcare IT, Online Education, etc.) and focus of the story
angle in terms of company-building experience. We use the
revenue level as a qualification criterion for selecting
entrepreneurs to profile. We don't necessarily have to publish
this number in the actual story. The Entrepreneur Journeys
series has already produced 12 books
(http://tinyurl.com/4p4phwy). You can see examples of the series
on our blog (http://tinyurl.com/d8m9mt). This blog is part of
the One Million by One Million global initiative, whose aim is
to help a million entrepreneurs reach $1 million in annual
revenue. We also use the EJ interviews as case studies to teach
other entrepreneurs how to navigate the entrepreneurial waters.
You get publicity, as well as a platform to share your lessons
from the trenches with a large number of aspiring and practicing
entrepreneurs. 1M/1M has syndication relationships with many
venues: HBR, Xconomy, SmallBizTrends, EconomicTimes (India),
Women 2.0, Mashable, Huffington Post, Business Insider,
ReadWriteWeb, and several other sites. Articles we develop
through these interviews often get repackaged for the
syndication partners. The 1Mby1M blog was named by Forbes in the
Top 100 Blog for Entrepreneurs (http://onforb.es/1a6RkOs). The
procedure is to have a one-hour interview by phone or in-person
in Menlo Park, at our office. We will provide the dial-in for
phone interviews, and the address for the in-person interviews.

Requirements:

When you send in your pitch, please be sure to include the
revenue level, as it is the primary criterion we use to select
stories. Unlike other entrepreneurship media, we do not look for
financing as a criterion for determining story worthiness. Also,
if your revenue threshold is below the $5M level currently, you
are welcome to email me, and I will check if your story might
fit in any of our other series. To give you a flavor, here are
some of our other ongoing series: The 1M/1M Deal Radar: Revenue
between $1M and $5M, high growth rate. We typically do email
interviews for this series. Thought Leader Interviews: We also
have Thought Leader Series opportunities in Cloud Computing,
Cyber Security, Mobile and Social, Big Data, Outsourcing, Online
Education, e-commerce, Gaming, Online Fashion, HealthcareIT,
Internet Of Things, etc. These require, however, that the
company has a minimum of $5M in revenue.

Solo dining is a thing, and single diners aren't shy about

dining. Americans now eat 50% of their means alone, as
households grow busier and more people make dining alone the new

to the taste, nutrition and ambience demands of single eaters.
--- We need experts to examine the issue of solo dining. Why is
it becoming such a big topic? Why are there so many solo diners?
Is the stigma of dining out alone going away? Why or why not?
Or, how about ordering in and eating alone? How much of a trends
is that, as well? Any tips or programs that cater to solo
diners, eating out or at home? What's your take on the solo
dining issue and why?
